# OBJECTIVE
To create a single centralized platform for patient health management and hospital supervision.

# TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES USED
The application is created with Next JS (React based framework) and represents the design for the developed idea. Javascript is used as the programming language.

# IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN

# STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT
Firstly clone the repository into your local working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Rahul171201/health-administration-app.git
```
cd into the repository
```
cd health-administration-app
```
Then install all the required dependencies
```
npm install
```
Finally start the project and go to localhost
```
npm run dev
```

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
* The application can further include options for patient admissions to hospital wards or medical labs. This may automatically allot specific helpers having definite working hours to the respective patients. Doctors can use this application to check up on patient&#x27;s status and manage their routines.

* The application is only avaliable for desktop devices and does not have backend integration (hard coded). So the application can be further developed with databases and backend servers and can also be made responsive for all types of devices.

* The application can be further developed to deal with real time data streaming to handle large number of users and data.
