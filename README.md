# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
* The application can further include options for patient admissions to hospital wards or medical labs. This may automatically allot specific helpers having definite working hours to the respective patients. Doctors can use this application to check up on patient&#x27;s status and manage their routines.

* The application is only avaliable for desktop devices and does not have backend integration (hard coded). So the application can be further developed with databases and backend servers and can also be made responsive for all types of devices.

* The application can be further developed to deal with real time data streaming to handle large number of users and data.
